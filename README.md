# 3DImHistNet: Learnable 3D Image Histogram-based DNN

This code is the 3D extention of 2D ImHistNet proposed in this [paper](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~hamarneh/ecopy/miccai2019e.pdf) in MICCAI 2019. This 3D module can be incorporated into a conventional CNN. For details about the algorithm, you can check this [repository](https://github.com/marafathussain/ImHistNet).
